# swiftuitutorials
## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to track all iOS projects built while learning about SwiftUI while taking the SwiftUI Masterclass by Credo Academy on Udemy. These projects were led by the instructor, however there were several improvements and bug fixes that I made that were different from the given tutorials. This mostly includes adaptations for newer versions of iOS & Swift that no longer support prevalent features.

## Credit
Credit to Robert Petras and Credo Academy for their course that led the development of all projects contained in this repository.
